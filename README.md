pilight firmware
=============

this is an rf receiver prefilter for pilight build with an ATTiny45 / 85. it prefilters the received signal to reduce the load for pilight (http://www.pilight.org).
you be warned: this could potentionally damage your raspberry pi and also other hardware. i take no responsability for any damages! use at your own risk!

1. Install avrgcc:
------------------
	sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc

2. Install modified avrdude:
-------------------
	wget http://project-downloads.drogon.net/files/avrdude_5.10-4_armhf.deb
	wget http://project-downloads.drogon.net/files/avrdude-doc_5.10-4_all.deb
	sudo dpkg -i avrdude_5.10-4_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i avrdude-doc_5.10-4_all.deb

3. Calculate the MIN_PULSELENGTH and MAX_PULSELENGTH values
-------------------
	MIN_PULSELENGTH =  ( shortest expected pulse - 10% ) / 10
	MAX_PULSELENGTH =  ( longest expected pulse + 10% ) / 10
	
	the shortest expected pulse is the minimal base pulse-width of all your protocols
	the longest expected pulse is the maximal base pulse-width of all your protocols multiplied by 34
	
4. Compile and program ATTiny:
------------------------------
	make all

###Pinout:
	
I use this circuit without resistors. if you want you can even power the ATTiny with 3.3V, it works for 4 out 5 ATTiny's, but i think the timing is less accurate.

|  Name  | Raspberry Pi V2 | ATTiny45 | 433 Receiver|
|--------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
|  MOSI  |       19        |    5     |      -      |
|  MISO  |       21        |    6     |      -      |
|  SCK   |       23        |    7     |      -      |
| RESET  |       24        |    1     |      -      |
| PI_IN  | see pilight cfg |    2     |      -      |
|REC_OUT |       -         |    3     |   DATA_OUT  |


to change the pins create an .avrduderc file in your home directory containing (the numbering is wiringpi numbering!):


	programmer
		id    = "gpio";
		desc  = "Use sysfs interface to bitbang GPIO lines";
		type  = gpio;
		reset = 8;
		sck   = 11;
		mosi  = 10;
		miso  = 9;
	;

###ATTiny85

If you want to program an ATTiny85 you need to change the following settings in the Makefile:

```
MCU=attiny45
AVRDUDEMCU=t45
```
to
```
MCU=attiny85
AVRDUDEMCU=t85
```
